1. What is the difference between NULL and 0?

NULL represents a missing or unknown value.
0 is a valid numerical value.
Example:-SELECT * FROM table WHERE salary IS NULL; -- Checks for missing values

2. What is a default constraint?

It assigns a default value to a column if no value is provided during insertion.
Example: CREATE TABLE employees (
  emp_id INT,
  salary INT DEFAULT 25000
);

3. How does IS NULL work?

It is used to check whether a column contains a NULL value.
Example: SELECT * FROM employees WHERE email IS NULL;

4. How do you update multiple rows?

Use the UPDATE command with a condition that matches multiple rows.
Example: UPDATE employees SET department = 'Sales' WHERE department IS NULL;

5. Can we insert partial values?

Yes, we can insert into specific columns.
The remaining columns take NULL or DEFAULT values.
Example: INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name) VALUES (6, 'Sana');


6. What happens if a NOT NULL field is left empty?

The database throws an error.
Example:
INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, department) VALUES (7, 'IT');
-- Error: 'name' column is NOT NULL but not provided

7. How do you rollback a deletion?

Use BEGIN TRANSACTION and ROLLBACK to undo.
Example: BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM employees WHERE emp_id = 3;
ROLLBACK;

8. Can we insert values into specific columns only?

Yes. You can specify column names in the INSERT INTO statement.
Example: INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name) VALUES (8, 'Ramesh');

Use INSERT INTO ... SELECT ... syntax.
Example: INSERT INTO employees (emp_id, name, department, salary, email)
SELECT 9, 'Copy John', department, salary, email
FROM employees
WHERE emp_id = 1;


10. What is ON DELETE CASCADE?

It is a foreign key constraint that deletes child rows when the parent row is deleted.
Example: CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT,
  emp_id INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (emp_id) REFERENCES employees(emp_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
